# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for invalid or missing data in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**

The original code lacks proper validation and error handling for the user data received in the POST request to `/users`.  If the request body is missing or contains invalid data, the application might crash or silently fail, making debugging difficult.

**Solution:**

The solution includes:

1. **Input validation:** Checking if the `req.body` contains the required data.
2. **Error handling:** Using try...catch blocks or callbacks to handle potential errors during database operations.
3. **Proper HTTP status codes:** Returning appropriate status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) to inform the client about the error.

This improved error handling leads to more robust and reliable applications.
